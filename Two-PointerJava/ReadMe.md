# Two-PointerJava

This repository contains Java solutions for various problems implemented using the Two Pointer algorithm approach.

## Prerequisites

To run or contribute to the code in this repository, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
- Understanding of basic data structures such as arrays and HashMaps.
- Familiarity with algorithms like Two Pointer.

## Contents

1. **ReverseStringSolution.java**:
   This Java code defines a class named ReverseString with a method to reverse the order of characters in an input character array by iterating through it from both ends and swapping characters until the middle is reached.

2. **target.java**:
   This Java code defines a class named "target" with a main method that initializes an array of integers and a target value, then creates an instance of the "target" class to call the "findsoln" method which iterates through the array, storing complementary values in a hashmap, and returns the indices of the two numbers whose sum equals the target value, if found.
