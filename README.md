# Two Pointer Algorithm Solutions

# Pick your Poison

This repository contains solutions for various problems implemented using the Two Pointer algorithm approach. Below is a brief description of each solution:

1. **strStr() Function**:
   - Language: Kotlin
   - Description: Implements the `strStr()` function, which finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring (`needle`) in a string (`haystack`) using the Two Pointer algorithm.

2. **LinkedListCycle**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Detects whether a linked list contains a cycle using the Two Pointer algorithm.

3. **MoveZero**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Moves all zeros present in an array to the end without changing the order of other elements, using the Two Pointer algorithm.

4. **MergeSortedArray**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array using the Two Pointer algorithm.

5. **ReverseStringSolution**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Reverses a string using the Two Pointer algorithm.

6. **Target**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Finds a pair of elements in an array whose sum equals a given target, using the Two Pointer algorithm.

7. **ThreeSumSolution**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Finds all unique triplets in an array whose sum is zero, using the Two Pointer algorithm.

8. **TrapWater**:
   - Language: C#
   - Description: Calculates the amount of water that can be trapped between bars in an elevation map, using the Two Pointer algorithm.

9. **numRescueBoats**:
   - Language: Kotlin
   - Description: Determines the minimum number of boats required to rescue people given their weights and a weight limit, using the Two Pointer algorithm.

10. **target**:
    - Language: Java
    - Description: Finds a pair of elements in an array whose sum equals a given target, using the Two Pointer algorithm.

11. **IntersectionOfLinkedList**:
    - Language: C#
    - Description: This C# class finds the intersection node of two singly-linked lists by traversing them simultaneously until they meet or reach the end.

Each solution showcases the application of the Two Pointer algorithm to solve specific problems efficiently.
