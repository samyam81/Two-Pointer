# TwoPointer

Here are 15 practice questions to help you master this technique:

Two Sum: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Three Sum: Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Container With Most Water: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Trapping Rain Water: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Sort Colors: Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Minimum Window Substring: Given a string s and a string t, find the minimum window in s which will contain all the characters in t in complexity O(n).

Linked List Cycle II: Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

Merge Sorted Array: Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Move Zeroes: Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Valid Palindrome: Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Reverse Linked List II: Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in one-pass.

Intersection of Two Linked Lists: Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

Linked List Cycle: Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
